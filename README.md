# Segmentation_and_Analysis-_-of-_Pelvic_Bones_in_CT_Images
The procedure to perform multi-atlas-based segmentation to obtain the segmentation of hip bones as well as image classification are presented. Affine linear registration and b-splines Free Form Deformation are used as registration methods. K-Nearest Neighbor is selected as classifier to detect the location of pubic symphysis.
